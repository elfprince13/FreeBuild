Getting Started With FreeBuild
==============================

1. [Vision](#vision)


Vision
------
Imagine being able to build any Lego creation you can imagine without running out of pieces. Imagine being able to build a mech, or a spaceship, or a tank, and immediately jumping into the pilot's seat for a fight to the death. Imagine building secret bases under the kitchen stove, and towns in the cupboards, and then leveling them, or dashing through the streets of a medieval village playing capture the flag.

Anyone should be able to build a world, and anyone should be able to build a game in that world. We want to support both of those things.

Core principles: Fun, Free, Extensible.

To get a sense of what we're aiming for, [try downloading the old TGE 1.5.2 based release](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1mbObopzHjwc05Ccmp2azR1N1U/edit?usp=sharing). Vehicles and weapons and players still need to be modeled externally, and we don't have LDraw support yet, but the awesome building and modding mechanics are there. Here are also some inspiring screenshots of days gone by, to inspire us to strive for new heights of greatness:
